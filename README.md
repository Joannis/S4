# Swift X

Cross project standards for Swift

## Mission

It is Swift X's mission to create concise, clear, and well-documented standards to which all Swift projects can conform. By standarzing certain common functionalities, Swift X allows for radically improved cross-project compatibility for anything Swift. More compatibility means more collaboration which benefits each individual project as well as the Swift community as a whole.

Swift X strives to maintain the following core beliefs for all of its standards:
- Inclusive
    - Swift X standards should be unbiased and easy to adopt for all Swift projects.
- Community
    - Open Source and open to comments, criticisms, and pull requests.
- Performant
    - Conforming to Swift X standards should have the minimum possible impact on performance possible.
- Minimum viable requirements
    - Only the code that is absolutely necessary for cross-project compatibility will be included.
- Best practices
    - Swift X should abide by any widely accepted best practices in the Swift community, like naming conventions.
